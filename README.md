# KNN-Bad-Hubs
The final project for the University of Waterloo course STAT844, which I completed during the Summer 2020 semester. Consists in an investigation into Buza, Nanopoulos and Nagy's algorithm for K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) in data sets with bad hubs (observations that act as nearest neighbours to multiple other instances while having a high predictor variance). See 10.1016/j.knosys.2015.06.010.
