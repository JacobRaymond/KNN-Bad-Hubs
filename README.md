# KNN-Bad-Hubs
Buza, Nanopoulos, and Nagy's method for K Nearest Neighbours in the presence of bad hubs.

The final project for the University of Waterloo course STAT844, which I completed during the Summer 2020 semester. Consists in an investigation into Buza, Nanopoulos and Nagy's algorithm for K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) in data sets with bad hubs (observations that act as nearest neighbours to multiple other instances while having a high predictor variance).
